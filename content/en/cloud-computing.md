## What it is

Cloud computing is a model that offers compute resources like CPU, network, and disk capabilities on-demand over the internet, allowing users to access and use computing power in a remote physical location. 
Cloud providers offer third parties the ability to rent access to compute resources in multiple geographic locations.
Users rent these compute resources in a public or private virtual cloud (PVC).
In a public cloud, users share physical hardware with other users, whereas in a PVC, the user rents an entire server. 

## Problem it addresses

Organizations traditionally faced two main problems when attempting to expand their use of computing power. 
They either acquire, support, design, and pay for facilities 
to host their physical servers and network or expand and maintain those facilities. 
Cloud computing allows organizations to outsource some of their computing needs to another organization.

## How it helps

Cloud providers allow organizations to rent compute resources on-demand and pay for usage, delivering two key benefits.
Organizations can focus on their product or service without waiting, planning, and spending resources on new physical infrastructure. They can simply [scale](/scalability/) as needed and on-demand.
Cloud computing allows organizations to adopt as much or as little infrastructure as they need.
